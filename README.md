**Simulation: probability that two people sit in same row**

This repository includes `simulate_same_row.py`, a small Python script that uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability that two people (a and b) sit in the same row when there are three rows with 5, 6, and 7 seats.

Run the simulation:

```bash
python3 simulate_same_row.py --trials 200000
```

You can pass `--seed N` for reproducible results and change `--trials` to control accuracy.
